            <p>Hello. This is a project to accurately and easily give you vegetarian options at fast food restaurants.</p>
            <p>The term "vegetarian" here permits the consumption of dairy and eggs, and the shared use of cooking surfaces used in the preparation of meat. French fries that share a fryer with chicken will still be classified "vegetarian". The data herein is manually scraped.</p>
